# Conclusion

Our journey of learning data build tool (dbt) has taken us from how to set it up, how to create models, how to use seeds, how to snapshot data, use jinja and macros to create custom functions and finally, as the final nail on the coffin, how to set up an externally hosted dbt website, albeit with rudimentary means. Except for a bit of lack of sufficient information on the topic of hooks and how to host on Google cloud, it is our wish that this book will enable you to come to speed with using dbt in your data. With the growth of using data warehouses and big data in institutions, we are sure dbt will always be one of the key tools for data handling.

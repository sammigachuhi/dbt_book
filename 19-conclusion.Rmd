# Conclusion

Our journey of learning data build tool (dbt) has taken us from how to set it up, creating models, setting up seeds, taking snapshots of data, and using jinja and macros to create custom functions. Finally, as the final nail on the coffin, we saw how to set up an externally hosted dbt website on Github. Except for insufficient knowledge on hooks and how to host a dbt website on Google cloud, it is our wish that this book will enable you to come to speed with using dbt in your data. With the growth of using data warehouses and exploiting big data already happening in various institutions, we are sure dbt will always be one of the key tools for data handling.

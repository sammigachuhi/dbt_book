# About

Samuel Gachuhi is a geographer who by fate found himself in the programming world. He holds a certificate in data science and machine learning and another in deep learning with Tensorflow from Udemy. He was motivated to write this book on dbt after noticing that most text on dbt was centred, written and filled with jargon only comprehensible to software engineers. Believing that knowledge transfer should be conveyed in a manner that is understandable by all, he sought to write this book in a less technical manner, and infusing it with humour since learning should be enjoyable, not painful.

The online version of the book is available from this [link](https://bookdown.org/sammigachuhi/dbt_book/). The online book is better than the pdf as it does not have some pieces of code clipped out at the edges.

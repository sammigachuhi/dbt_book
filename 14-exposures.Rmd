# Exposures 

Imagine a soldier dropping a piece of paper containing their camp, trails they use and the military equipment that is due to arrive only for it to be picked up by a wondering enemy. That would be catastrophic, right? That is akin to exposing them into the line of fire. However, exposures in dbt serve a good purpose. They show how your data is used by downstream project, be they be notebooks, a dashboard or another data pipeline. They only thing that sets apart exposures from other models is that this time round you are the one who defines which projects will be used downstream.


## Creating an exposure 

Exposures are written in YAML files but nested under the `exposures:` key. Below is an exposure created in the `exposure/exposures.yml` path. 

```
version: 2

exposures:

  - name: station_bikes_exposure
    label: A join of station tables and bike rides
    type: dashboard
    maturity: high
    url: https://public-toilets-in-australia-infomap.onrender.com/
    description: '{{ doc("citi_trips_round") }}'

    depends_on:
      - ref('citi_trips_round')
      - ref('citi_trips_minutes') # Added this just to increase complexity of lineage graph
      - source('nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014', '2014-tripdata')

    owner:
      name: Mr Fantastic
      email: mrfantastic@unlike.com

```

Below is the definition of each property used above.

**Required**

* `name`: a unique exposure name written in snake case

* `type`: one of dashboard, notebook, analysis, ml, application (used to organize in docs site)

* `owner`: name or email required; additional properties allowed


**Expected**

`depends_on`: list of refable nodes, including `metric`, `ref`, and `source`. While possible, it is highly unlikely you will ever need an `exposure` to depend on a `source` directly.


**Optional**


* `label`: May contain spaces, capital letters, or special characters.
  
* `url`: Activates and populates the link to View this exposure in the upper right corner of the generated documentation site
    
* `maturity`: Indicates the level of confidence or stability in the exposure. One of high, medium, or low. For example, you could use high maturity for a well-established dashboard, widely used and trusted within your organization. Use low maturity for a new or experimental analysis.


**General properties (optional)**

* description
* tags
* meta



Running an exposure

To run the exposure we just created, we use the following one liner. The plus line is there to indicate to dbt to include all models used to feed into the `station_bikes_exposure` exposure. 


```
dbt run --select +exposure:station_bikes_exposure
```

It is noteworthy to mention that you run the `name` value under the `exposures` key. The name of the YAML is not used when running exposures.

Here is the output:

```
20:31:06  Concurrency: 1 threads (target='dev')

20:31:12  
20:31:12  Done. PASS=2 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=2

```

One can also decide to test all the upstream models for our exposure. The below code will display test results for all the three models defined by the `depends_on` key.

```
19:37:44  Concurrency: 1 threads (target='dev')
19:37:44  
19:37:44  1 of 23 START test dbt_expectations_expect_column_max_to_be_between_citi_trips_minutes_trip_duration_min__326000__16  [RUN]
19:37:49  1 of 23 PASS dbt_expectations_expect_column_max_to_be_between_citi_trips_minutes_trip_duration_min__326000__16  [PASS in 5.51s]
19:37:49  2 of 23 START test dbt_expectations_expect_column_max_to_be_between_citi_trips_round_trip_duration_min__326000__16  [RUN]
19:37:53  2 of 23 PASS 
-- snip --

```

Nevertheless, we remain with visualizing our exposure.

## Visualizing the exposure 

Visualizing exposures is as simple as just generating your dbt documentation. This is actually the default way of displaying exposures. It begins with `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`. Afterwards, open the dbt documentation static web page in the port number provided. Ours is `localhost:/8080`.

![Exposure](./images/exposure_webpage.png)



You will notice that there is a dedicated section for exposures called `Exposures`. The exposure title is `Dashboard` and the label for the exposure is the label provided in the YAML. 

If you click on the blue lineage graph button, you will see the upstream models that feed into our exposure.

![Exposure lineage graph](./images/exposure_lineage_graph.png)

Still at the bottom of the webpage, the **Depends on** section contains links to all the upstream models and references for your exposure. Clicking on any takes you to the dbt documentation site for that model.

Finally, there is the **View this exposure** button. Clicking on it will take you to the url you specified in the `url:` key of the exposures file. In our case, the url leads to a Dashboard showing all the public sanitation facilities in Australia. Obviously there is no relation between bikes and sanitation facilities as this is just for demonstration purposes only!

Working with exposures can be fun. You can add as many exposures as you wish. Below we extended the `exposures` YAML to also include the following `station_bikes_application` exposure.

```
-- snip --
- name: station_bikes_application
    label: An app of stations and bike rides
    type: application
    maturity: high
    url: https://data-visualization-for-diarrhoea-deaths.onrender.com/
    description: '{{ doc("citi_trips_round") }}'

    depends_on:
      - ref('citi_trips_long')
      - ref('citi_trips_minutes') # Added this just to increase complexity of lineage graph
      - source('nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014', '2014-tripdata')

    owner:
      name: Mr Fantastic
      email: mrfantastic@unlike.com

```

Once again, to include this exposure, we run `dbt run --select +exposure:station_bikes_application`. Thereafter create a documentation using the two sesame magic characters of `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`. 

The above exposure of `station_bikes_application` falls under the **Application** section as specified in the `type` key. 

![Exposure application](./images/exposure_application.png)

The lineage graph and the **View this exposure** buttons work for this exposure as well. In fact the lineage graph is the most complex so far. The exposure took into consideration that the `citi_trips_long` model is depedent on the `citi_trips_minutes` and `citi_trips_round` models!

The exposure button also leads to a dashboard showing rates of some sanitation related disease. Again, not related to bikes and stations but serves the purpose of demonstration.

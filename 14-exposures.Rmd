# Exposures 

Think of a strategic plan by a major company. Inside the strategic plan, they detail their goals and how certain actions will contribute to that goal. Exposures in dbt showcase to the real world what comprises your project, and how it impacts other downstream applications. For example, in a strategic plan, even speaking with optimism, the reports details very clearly how certain actions will contribute to reaching a certain goal. The inverse is also true, but the language of the report also shows this without utilizing words. Exposures in dbt show how each model is linked to the output. The difference between the lineage graph in exposures versus the one automatically generated by `docs generate`, is that in the former the dependent models are hardcoded in a YAML file while in the latter the dependent models are linked on the go based on your SQL models in dbt.This may sound strange, but it is sometimes better to hardcode the dependent models say, when you have a model that is dependent on thousands of other models. It is harder to debug the latter than the first.

## Creating an exposure 

Exposures are written in YAML files.


Running an exposure

```
dbt run --select +exposure:station_bikes_exposure
```

Here is the output

```

```
Create docs the normal way


```
dbt docs generate
```

```
dbt docs serve
```

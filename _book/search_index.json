You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is dbt? 2.2 Encounter with dbt 2.3 dbt, from the professionals… 2.4 Why use dbt?", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is dbt? dbt, when in full, stands for Data build tool. dbt is a tool that data scientists and analytical engineers use to transform data in their data warehouses. If you are a newbie wanting to, or rather curious about dbt, the preceding statements sure contains a lot. The words analytical engineers, transform data and data warehouses may sound unfamiliar, if not imposing. For now just think of dbt much like a recipe. In a recipe, you have the steps and the instructions to cook your favourite meal, say a roasted chicken. Sure enough, your recipe will contain details on the optimal oven temperature, heating duration and how to set it! dbt works in much the same way. We define how we want to transform or build our data. Once we hit run the magic happens. 2.2 Encounter with dbt How did I come across dbt? Being from a totally different background, the geographical sciences, my first experience with dbt, contrary to what veteran users may say, wasn’t so good. Either because a lot was on my desk back then, but I was having trouble piecing together all the different components that make dbt work, or dbt uses to work. Whichever is the case. It is only after some time, and several hard knocks in between, that I was able to get a semblance of what it does. At least I got a few things. dbt could be used to create views of your tables in the data warehouse, it could perform tests and lastly, (the one I liked the most) it could be used to render a website of your documentation! 2.3 dbt, from the professionals… dbt, from the words of developers, is an open-source tool that analysts and data engineers use to transform data in their data warehouses. Did someone mention transform data somewhere? Data transformation is the process of converting data from its source format to the format required for analysis. The data transformation process is part of a three stage process known as Extract Load and Transform (ELT). Before ELT, Extract Transform Load was the king. The former involves transfering data from the source, to the destination, such as a data warehouse or data lake and performing the transformation in the destination. The latter, though a traditional approach, involves first identifying the data, transforming it prior to landing it to the destination, in this case data warehouse and letting it rest there where downstream users can get hold of it. Here is a better description of the Extract, Load and Transform keywords. Extract - this is the identification and reading of data from one or more sources, such as databases, internet, comma separated value (csv) files and the like. Load - just like you would pull up a weight into a lorry, this is the process of transferring data from the source to your data warehouse. Transform - this is the conversion of data from its state to a format that can be used by downstream users. You may have seen the term data warehouse coming up quite a number of times. A data warehouse is a data management system that stores current and historical data from multiple sources in a business friendly manner for easier insights and reporting. Examples of data warehouses are Google Big Query, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics, IBM Db2 Warehouse and Firebolt. 2.4 Why use dbt? If you work with data that needs to be version controlled, that is, it can be rolled back to a previous time, you need to work in dbt. If you want to standardize the data models created across teams, dbt is the tool of choice. If you also want a central place where your data work is documented, dbt handles this quite well. In other words, dbt should be the swiss knife when working with large datasets and you want to maintain modularity, order and documentation of your work.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

# Snapshots

Picture this, there is this lady you have been eyeing, after many nights of turning and tossing, you decide to visit her place because she is currently not anywhere interested in being taken out. When you visit her at the rendezvous, you decide to ask her to take a 'selfie' of you and her (big mistake). You think she will send the selfie to you, she never does. Well, that's a true story of yours truly and even though no hard feelings over the incident, snapshots in dbt work in much the same way. 

A snapshot in dbt is a recorded change of a mutable table over time. Think of a snapshot as a way to track changes in your data over time. For example, you could be a having a crazy table that logs your relationship status with your girlfriend or boyfriend over time. The first row could be as follows:

```
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| id       |  Status      | updated-at    |
| 11       |  Spark       | 21/09/2024    |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
```

Now let's say, you realise something about your girlfriend and boyfriend that puts a freeze on the relationship, so in your relationship table it would have the following update.

```
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| id       |  Status      | updated-at    |
| 11       |  Shaky       | 22/10/2024    |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
```

The relationship would now be 'shaky' subject to external forces and internal will, but our update may have overwritten the previous record of 'Spark' when the relationship was at cloud nine. dbt offers a way to preserve these past records so that they can be used for further analysis, or for posterity purposes. For example, keeping a record of the change can be used to analyse how long the relationship lasted from its hey days to when the waves started beating the ship. This kind of analysis can be used for more serious matters, such as when analyzing the time it takes from sending to receiving an order. dbt will help you record these changes and log the time when the change took place. For example, our dbt snapshot for our relationship would be:


|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| id       |  Status      | updated-at    | dbt_valid_from | dbt_valid_to |
| 11       |  Spark       | 21/09/2024    | 21/09/2024     | 22/10/2024   |
| 11       |  Shaky       | 22/10/2024    | 22/10/2024     | null         |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|


The most up-to-date record will have a value of `null` in the `dbt_valid_to` field. Here is a description of the last two fields and those used internally by dbt. 

1. `dbt_valid_from` - The timestamp when this snapshot row was first inserted. This column can be used to order the different "versions" of a record. 

2. `dbt_valid_to` - The timestamp when this row became invalidated. The most recent snapshot record will have dbt_valid_to set to null.

3. `dbt_scd_id` - 	A unique key generated for each snapshotted record. This is used internally by dbt.

4. `dbt_updated_at` - The updated_at timestamp of the source record when this snapshot row was inserted. This is used internally by dbt.

Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) refers to the way data changes over time in a data warehouse. In today's world, one wouldn't say that data changes slowly, but the term arises from the fact that even though data may change infrequently, such as makeups and breakups in your relationship, they are significant over time even to the future of the relationship or the continuity of your business!

SCDs are typically of three types:

* **Type 1**: This is where old data is overwritten without any preservation of its history. Old data ceases to exist with update of new data.

* **Type 2**: When a new record of data is added, the old record is preserved as historical data. This is the most common type of SCD and which dbt implements. 

* **Type 3**: This approach adds a new column for the new data and preserves the old data in the original column. This type is best used to see the progression of changes *rather* than when a change happened. 

Therefore, when *snapshoting* in dbt, when a change occurs in the source data, instead of overwriting the existing record (Type 1) or a dding a new column (Type 3), dbt adds a new record with the new data (Type 2). The `dbt_valid_from` and `dbt_valid_to` columns in the snapshot table indicate when each version of the record was valid, allowing you to track the full history of changes over time. This looks much like git commits, only that the commits are in tabular form.

## Create a snapshot

Creating a snapshot in dbt to some extent depends on the version you are using. Starting from version 1.9, you will actually need two files to perform a dbt snapshot. These are the YAML and sql files. However, this tutorial was written using version 1.8.7. To know the dbt version you are using, type `dbt debug`. You will see your version listed like so:

```
--snip--
19:41:25  Running with dbt=1.8.7
19:41:25  dbt version: 1.8.7
19:41:25  python version: 3.10.12
--snip--
```

Now to create a snapshot using dbt versions lower than for 1.9, you will create a snapshot SQL file with the following configurations.

```
{% snapshot tripdata_snapshot %}

{{
  config(      
    target_schema='snapshots',      
    strategy='check',      
    unique_key='_id',      
    check_cols='all'    
  )  
}}  

SELECT * FROM {{ source('nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014', '2014-tripdata') }}

{% endsnapshot %}
```

Let's go through it line by line. The macros `{% snapshot tripdata_snapshot %}` and `{% endsnapshot %}` indicate that this is a snapshot file. Your configurations will go inside the `config()` function. 

`target_schema` - this is the schema in which your snapshot will be stored. 

`strategy` - this is the mechanism by which dbt will know that a row has changed. The `timestamp` strategy, and the most recommended for that matter, uses an `updated_at` column to determine if a row has changed. On the other hand, the `check` strategy compares a list of columns between their current and historical state to determine what has changed. Use the `check` strategy if there is no reliable `updated_at` column for tracking changes with time, as in our case.

`unique_key` - this is the unique key in your table that dbt will use.

`check_cols` - These are the columns to check for changes. The `all` parameter can be passed in case you want to track changes in all the columns of the row. 

One can also add an additional `invalidate_hard_deletes` [configuration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots) to track rows that have been deleted. The `dbt_valid_to` column of deleted rows will be set to the current snapshot time.

Finally, the `SELECT` statement. You will insert inside the `source()` function the table in which you would like to track changes. 

Thereafter, run `dbt snapshot`. Below is the output. 

```

```

A new table should appear under the `snapshots` schema in BigQuery. 

![Snapshots schema](./images/snapshots_schema.png)

When you run `dbt snapshot` the first time, the `dbt_valid_to` column will be `null` for all records. Thereafter, when you run subsequent `dbt snapshot` executions for a table that has undergone a change, the `dbt_valid_to` will be populated with a timestamp value in the `dbt_valid_to` of the altered row. 

## Record row changes 

Now is the time to truly test if our snapshots work. Go to the SQL tab of your Big Query and insert a new row using this query:

```
INSERT INTO `dbt-project-437116`.`nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014`.`2014-tripdata` (`_id`, `tripduration`, `start station name`) 
VALUES (000000, 1000, 'Nowhere Near Station');
```

Thereafter run `dbt snapshot`. 

Ensure that the new row has been added by crosschecking its existence via:

```
SELECT * FROM `dbt-project-437116`.`nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014`.`2014-tripdata`
WHERE `start station name` = 'Nowhere Near Station';
```

Now check if our `tripdata_snapshot` table has captured the new row using the below query.

```
SELECT * FROM `dbt-project-437116`.`snapshots`.`tripdata_snapshot`
WHERE `start station name` = 'Nowhere Near Station';
```

Its a new row of data, which means all columns have been affected with a new value in each. Remember we set the `check_cols=all`. 

![Recorded change](./images/inserted_new_row.png)

Let's go on.

Insert a new row, with an additional extra change in the `_id` column.

```
UPDATE `dbt-project-437116`.`nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014`.`2014-tripdata`
SET `start station name` = 'Even Further Station', `_id` = 1001995
WHERE `_id` = 0;
```

Again, run `dbt snapshot`. Always run `dbt snapshot` when you suspect, or where in actual sense your table has been updated, even if through automatic scheduling. 

Let's check if the new row with two updates has been recorded in our snapshots table.

```
SELECT * FROM `dbt-project-437116`.`snapshots`.`tripdata_snapshot`
WHERE `start station name` = 'Even Further Station';
```

If you run this, you will notice that the `dbt_valid_to` is still `null`. We presume this is because we have added a new unique key and thus dbt will still treat this as a new recorded rather than one which was changed from 0 to 1001995. 


Now, update the row with `_id` 1001995 using the below SQL query.

```
UPDATE `dbt-project-437116`.`nyc_bikes_nyc_bikes2014`.`2014-tripdata`
SET `start station name` = 'Furth East Station'
WHERE `_id` = 1001995;
```

Now after running `dbt snapshot` (we hope you remembered), let's see if our snapshot table will have tracked the historical change of `Even Further Station` and `Furth East Station` of row `_id` 1001995. Use the below query to unravel the results, drumrolls please...

```
SELECT * FROM `dbt-project-437116`.`snapshots`.`tripdata_snapshot`
WHERE `_id` = 1001995;
```

![Snapshot example](./images/snapshot_example.png)


Yes it did! For row 1, which stands for when the 'start station name' was `Even Further Station`, we can see that row was valid from 2024-10-24 19:29 to 2024-10-24 20:02. However, the new row 2, which is where the 'start station name' was switched to `Furth East Station`, we can see it became valid from 2024-10-24 20:02, the exact time when row was updated.

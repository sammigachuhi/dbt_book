# Macros

A macro in dbt is a reusable piece of code. That's it. A macro in dbt is what a function is to Python or JavaScript. The building block of a macro is the jinja template. Below is the structure of a dbt macro.

```
{% macro macro_name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) %}

    SQL logic here, using the parameters as needed.

{% endmacro %}

```

You begin a macro with the name `macro` and end it with `endmacro`. Macros are defined in SQL files and stored inside the already shipped `macros` folder in dbt. 


## Invoking a macro

There are three ways to call a macro. They are:

1. Using expression blocks

2. Call blocks

3. Run operation command 

### Invoking a macro using expression blocks

If the macro does not have any parameters, it can be invoked as a solo object like so:

```
{{ macro_name() }}

```

But if it has parameters, we have to call it with it's entire entourage.

```
{{ macro_name(arg1, arg2, argN) }}

```

### Invoke a macro using call blocks

In this method, one can invoke a macro inside another macro. Here is the template.

```
{% call called_macro( arg1, arg2, . . argN) %}

    Code to be accessed by the macro called_macro

{% endcall %}

```


The above code calls a macro called `called_macro` and everything in between the `{ %call% }` and `{% endcall %}` statements can be accessed using the `caller()` method. 


Here is an example of a macro.

```
{% macro select_all_columns_macro(table_name) %}

    SELECT *
    FROM {{ table_name }}
    WHERE {{ caller() }}

{% endmacro %}

```

Now, call the macro using call blocks.

```
{% call select_all_columns_macro('EVENT_TABLE') %}

CREATE_DATE >= '2020-02-18'::DATE

{%- endcall %}

```

When it is called it would render:

```
SELECT *
FROM EVENT_TABLE
WHERE CREATE_DATE >= '2020-02-18'::DATE
```

### Invoke a macro from the Command Line Interface (CLI)

To run a macro from the CLI or terminal, we use the `dbt run-operation {macro} --args '{args}'{macro}:` command. The macro will run with the arguments provided. The below macro being run from the CLI selects all columns from a table called `my_table`.

```
dbt run-operation select_all_columns --args '{table_name: my_table}'

```

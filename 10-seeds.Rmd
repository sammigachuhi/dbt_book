# Seeds

Seeds are Comma Separated Values (csv) files stored inside your `seeds` directory which can be loaded into your data warehouse using the `dbt seed` command. 

Seeds can also be referenced by your SQL models using the `ref()` function. Seeds in dbt are version controlled, that is, you can revert them to a previous state. 

Seeds are best used for data that changes infrequently. A good example is country codes, email accounts and station names. However, seeds should not be used to store sensitive information such as passwords.

To demonstrate about seeds in dbt, we will try to upload a [New York City (NYC) bike history data](https://www.civicdata.com/dataset/nyc-bike-share-trip-data/resource/3e7acf34-19ba-4bf4-8dd2-cf349623dc6b) for 2014.

Extract the zip folder and copy the `3e7acf34-19ba-4bf4-8dd2-cf349623dc6b.csv` inside the `dbt_book/seeds` directory. To avoid being verbose, let's rename it to `2014-tripdata.csv`. 

## Uploading a seed into your data warehouse

Believe you me we had a better csv table to upload, one much more related to the NYC bikes dataset. However, because it was ~320MB and we want to be economical in upload times, we settled for this historical data. Nevertheless, keeping on with this chapter, to upload a seed into a data warehouse, we use this command:

```
dbt seed
```

After that, it's a test of patience. Depending on your upload speeds, it shouldn't take long to upload a 36MB file to BigQuery.

```

```

If you go to BigQuery and refresh the contents of your `nyc_bikes` dataset, you should see the `2014-tripdata` table present.

## Referencing seeds in models

Just like you would reference a model in another model, we can also reference seeds in another model. All your need to reference a seed is to place the name of the csv file, excluding the `.csv` extension inside the `ref()` function. 

For example, we want to create a view that contains those start station names from our 2014 table that are existent in the `citi_trips_long` model.

Within the `models/my_models` directory, create the `citi_stations_2014.sql` model with the following query:

```
{{ config(materialized='view') }}

WITH citi_stations_2014 AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ref ('2014-tripdata') }}
    WHERE `start station name` IN (
        SELECT start_station_name FROM {{ ref('citi_trips_long') }}
    )
)

SELECT * FROM citi_stations_2014

```

Thereafter, run the model using `dbt run --select citi_stations_2014`

That will create a view that contains only those stations within the `2014-tripdata.csv` also within the `citi_trips_long` model. Much to our surprise, all the stations within our 2014 table are also found in the `citi_trips_long` model! 

Here are the SQL queries we used to perform a count of each of the two tables in BigQuery.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `dbt-project-437116`.`nyc_bikes`.`2014-tripdata`;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbt-project-437116.nyc_bikes.citi_stations_2014;
```

Both returned a value of `224736`.

Here is the view of the `citi_stations_2014` model in BigQuery.
